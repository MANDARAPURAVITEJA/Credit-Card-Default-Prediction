                    <span>Project Title:</span> CreditCard Default Prediction. 
                    <br>This project is about predicting the Defaulter for a Credit Card company based on the past 6 months' user data. 
                    <br><span>Provided:</span> We have provided user account details with Credit card transaction information from April to September(6 months).Expected: Based on this past data, we need to predict whether a user will be a Future Defaulter or not.
                    <br><span>Procedure followed: </span>
                    <br>1. Analyzed the data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and gave structure to the data.
                    <br>2. After we got some clarity and information about what data is, then performed Feature Engineering followed by Feature selection. 
                    <br>3. Feature selection was done based on the correlation between features.
                    <br>4. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, some sampling techniques are performed to balance the dataset. 
                    <br>5. Using GridSearchCV found the best hyperparameters for the dataset.
                    <br>6. Then, created pipelines for both categorical features and numerical features separately. Then combined into a single pipeline using ColumnTransformer.
                    <br>7. Trained the dataset with various models with the best hyperparameters found.
                    <br>8. Selected the best model by evaluating the model with performance metrics.
                    <br>9. So, by using the best model, we can predict whether a user will be Defaulter or not.
                    <br><span>Outcome:</span> Achieved the expected outcome by following all the above steps and obtained an accuracy of 82.1% for the best model.
                    <br><span>Conclusion:</span> Now, we can able to predict whether a user will be a Future Defaulter or not, based on his past 6 months' Credit card information.
